# Coding test tips
A set of tips and tricks to help you in coding tests

## More is better when it comes to commenting your code
You've got a limited amount of time to commit to coding in order to convince the reviewer how you would operate in a real world working environment.  Often the time spent commenting your code can significantly increase the insight the reviewer has into your thought process.  Make your time worthwhile! ðŸ˜€

## Clean git history
Make sure you have a nice clean Git history with [meaningful commit messages](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).  Definitely don't send a zip or single commit repo!

## Swiftlint/SwiftFormat or similar are very helpful
If you use a linter/formatter and provide the config file to the reviewer (and point out that you used one) then there can't be any issues about tabs or spaces!  More info on [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) and [SwiftFormat](https://github.com/nicklockwood/SwiftFormat)

## Just 1 or 2 unit tests go a long way
You don't need to write 100 tests, but just writing a couple shows that you can and makes a really good impression!  Again, use your time to great effect.

## 10m spent on a README will pay off
The first place I go when reviewing a coding test is the README.  Use this as a place to point out important information (design choices / where you would do more stuff if you had more time / architectural challenges / etc).  Again, a little time spent here can _really_ pay off and make your coding exercise more impactful.

Most of all, just have fun!
